This deliverable included the description of  a number of key aspects related to the PM design, implementation and validation. 
In particular, it included:
\begin{itemize}
\item The mechanisms and implementation details for the profile schemas and the privacy-enhancing technologies used by the PM;
\item The mechanisms and implementation details for the services that allow searching, matching and ranking of peers based on different attributes (i.e., characteristics) from their profiles;
\item The evaluation plans for the PM including analytical and user-based evaluations; and
\item The description of how the PM is currently integrated in the SmartSociety platform and used in different project-wide scenarios.
\end{itemize}
In the second half of 2015 the focus will be on the validation of the PM functionality and performance, following the strategy outlined in Sec.~\ref{sec:integration}. At the same time, feedback from empirical activities in WP8 and WP9 will be used to fine-tune the PM APIs and the underlying mechanisms, with particular emphasis on search and ranking functionality. The final PM design and implementation will be shipped with D4.4 at M42.
