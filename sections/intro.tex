This deliverable reports the work done on tasks T4.3 and T4.4. In particular, T4.3 covers the description of profiling mechanisms and privacy-aware algorithms including those for searching and ranking of peers. On the other hand, T4.4 refers to the implementation and integration of these mechanisms into the project infrastructure as well as the definition of an plan for evaluating them.

During the second year of the project, the WP4 worked on the refinement of models for data and knowledge representation and for privacy-aware storage, as well as the definition of mechanisms for matching atomic-tasks with peers and ranking matching results. 
As such, the main outcome was the definition of the \emph{Peer Manager (PM)} component as a privacy-aware storage for the information of peers in the SmartSociety platform. This definition included also the specification of a privacy-by-design architecture for the PM. The results of this work were reported in deliverable D4.2.
Although the focus of year 2 was on the definition of models and mechanisms, an initial prototype of the PM was also developed during such period and the early reports of this implementation was included in the deliverable D4.2.


The main objectives of this year (year 3 of the SmartSociety project) are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Provide a more complete implementation and integration of models and mechanisms proposed during the year 2 of the project.
\item The application of evaluation procedures that include the definition of an evaluation plan and its subsequent implementation.
\end{enumerate}
In this regard, it is important to note that this deliverable covers only partially the work towards the above mentioned objectives (i.e., until M30). As a consequence, only the definition of a plan for evaluation is presented in this document while its execution is planned for the second half of year 3 and the report of the evaluation results will be presented in the next deliverable.

The reminder of the deliverable is organized as follows, \ldots
