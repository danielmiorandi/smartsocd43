The following section specifies examples of the calls that the Proof of Concept version of the  Peer Manager accepts and the replies (example+format) that it produces. These are largely similar to what was reported last year (with minor usage-motivate changes), the bulk of the changes of this year implementation is reflected in the introduction of the PM abstraction API detailed in Appendix~\ref{sec:pm-abs-api-detail}.
