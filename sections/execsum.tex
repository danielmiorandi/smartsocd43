%\textcolor{red}{Executive summary: max 1 page, objectives of the deliverable, achievements and impact on the project as a whole.}

This deliverable reports the outcomes of the activities carried out in WP4 on the peer profiling schemas and the privacy-aware mechanisms defined for the Peer Manager (PM). In particular, it includes a detailed description of the implementation and integration into the project infrastructure as well as the definition of evaluation procedures. 
%The main focus of the reporting period was the identification of appropriate evaluation mechanisms and the definition of an evaluation plan that should be inline also with the overall project evaluation.
Another achievement described in the deliverable  %during this period of the Smart Society project 
is the definition and initial integration of the privacy-enhancing component of the PM (integration with PrimeLife Policy Language), which is a fundamental building block for managing the information of peers in a privacy-preserving manner. 

Content-wise, the deliverable presents:
%\begin{enumerate}
\begin{inparaenum}[\itshape (i)]
\item The mechanisms and implementation details for the profile schemas and the privacy-enhancing technologies used by the PM;
\item The mechanisms and implementation details for the services that allow searching, matching and ranking of peers based on different attributes (i.e., characteristics) from their profiles;
\item The evaluation plans for WP4 including analytical and user-based evaluations; and
\item The description of how the PM is currently integrated in the SmartSociety platform and used in different project-wide scenarios.
\end{inparaenum}
%\end{enumerate}

%It is important to note also that while an evaluation plan is presented in this document, the actual evaluation and therefore the implementation of such plan will start during the second half of year 3 and will be formally reported as part of deliverable D4.4.
