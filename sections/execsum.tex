%\textcolor{red}{Executive summary: max 1 page, objectives of the deliverable, achievements and impact on the project as a whole.}

This deliverable reports the evolution of the work done in WP4 with regard to the peer profiling schemas and the privacy-aware mechanisms defined for the Peer Manager (PM). In particular, it includes more details about the implementation and integration into de the project infrastructure as well as the definition of evaluation procedures. 
The main focus of the reporting period was the identification of appropriate evaluation mechanisms and the definition of an evaluation plan that should be inline also with the overall project evaluation.

Another WP4-related outcome during this period of the Smart Society project is the definition and initial integration of the privacy-enhancing component of the PM (integration with PPL), which is a fundamental building block for managing the information of peers in a privacy-preserving manner. 

More specifically, the report presented in this document includes:
%\begin{enumerate}
\begin{inparaenum}[\itshape (i)]
\item The mechanisms and implementation details for the profile schemas and the privacy-enhancing technologies used by the PM;
\item The mechanisms and implementation details for the service that allows searching, matching and ranking of peers based on different attributes (i.e., characteristics) from their profiles;
\item The evaluation plans including analytical and user-based evaluations; and
\item The details regarding the integration of the PM in the SmartSociety platform describing how the PM is used in the different project-wide scenarios.
\end{inparaenum}
%\end{enumerate}


It is important to note also that while an evaluation plan is presented in this document, the actual evaluation and therefore the implementation of such plan will start during the second half of year 3 and will be formally reported as part of deliverable D4.4.
